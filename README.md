# Mood Music

+ Mood Music is an app created in order to help a user find a playlist or new music to listen to based on mood. 
+ The user uploads an image in the specified input field, the image is processed by using an API developed by Kairos that detects 
emotion from images and gives 7 emotions a score between 0 & 1.
+ The highest scoring image gets put into a variable that in turn is pulled into a Spotify Search as well as pushed into the query for the
Giphy API, resulting in an image and a playlist displayed.
+ The user also has the option to specify what genre they would like their playlist to be.
+ A favorites tab is included where playlists can be saved and removed.
+ The app uses Firebase for user authentication.
